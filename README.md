#CSS grid-based framework

This simple framework has a css reset, a grid system for 12 different column widths, 4 different grid sizes (xs, sm, md, lg) that respond depending on the browser resolution, and a couple other basic settings for a navbar, buttons, and links. 


To use this framework, add 'grid_framework.css' to your project directory.  Don't forget to link to it in your html file(s).


The class names for the grids work as follows:


.col-(size)-(number for width with '12' being 100%)


ex. .col-md-12
